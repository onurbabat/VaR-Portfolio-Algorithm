# VaR-Portfolio-Algorithm

The project provides a novel approximation algorithm to solve computationally difficult VaR Portfolio Allocation Problem with Sample Average Approximation approach.

Modern portfolio theory, chance constrained programming, value-at-risk concepts are studied.

The test set is provided in the folder.
